# First_Hackathon_Project
This project was my group's submission for Virginia State University's first Hackathon. 

We chose the problem that asked us to create something that would help educate people on cybersecurity. My team consisted of 3 other members who did not know HTML, CSS, or Javascript before we began to create our project, so since I had experience with web programming, I took on the role of a teacher and a programmer. 

I worked on the main page and gave general assistance while my other teammates worked on the modules. When each member completed their portion of the project, I connected all the pages to the main webpage. 

Despite my team's lack of experience with hackathons and web programming, my team **won first place!**
